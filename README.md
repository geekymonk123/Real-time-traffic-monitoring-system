# Real-time-traffic-monitoring-system
Due to the rise of private vehicles (e.g., car) makes road
traffic more congested. To resolve this complex situation without man-
ual road traffic monitoring, computer vision takes place. The dedicated
road surveillance cameras and sensors are used as helping devices. Both
are costly. However, we are using the road side digital camera for road
traffic monitoring. Our research work mainly focused on vehicle detec-
tion along with the speed estimation and license plate detection with
the same camera in this article. The proposed method uses neural net-
work techniques Faster R-CNN for speed estimation, and for license plate
detection we use easy optical character recognition (OCR) system to ex-
tract the alphanumeric characters. Here we trained and tested our model
on 3 different scenarios and over 30 vehicles and get a result of 93.7%
accuracy for speed estimation and 87.5% on license plate detection.
